# Claude Code Workflow Guide

**v2.0 · for the team.** This document describes the full designer workflow in Claude Code: from setting up
the environment to finished pages and handoff to development.

The document is split into three parts:

| Part | For whom | Content |
|---|---|---|
| **I. For the designer** | 🧑‍🎨 designer | Step-by-step process — what to do by hand, from zero to pages. |
| **II. Rules for Claude** | 🤖 Claude | Design system that is placed in `CLAUDE.md` and applied automatically. |
| **III. Webflow export** | 🧑‍🎨 + 🤖 | Rules and sequence for handing the project over to Webflow. |

# Part I. For the designer — step-by-step process

Actions the designer performs, in order. Each step is a discrete operation.

Prerequisite (one-time): Claude Code is installed — `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`.

### Step 1. Load the project archive

Place the client ZIP archive into the project folder and unpack it. The archive holds all incoming materials:
brief, references, logo, fonts, images, brand guidelines and, if available, a ready design system.

### Step 2. Connect the folder to Claude

Open the folder in the Claude Code app, or `cd` into it in the terminal and run `claude`. The folder becomes
the session working directory, and Claude gains access to all materials.

### Step 3. Load the guide and hooks

Instruct Claude: "Run the guide and hooks." Claude loads the Part II ruleset and runs the session hooks, so
every subsequent action follows the design rules.

If your environment doesn't have the two localhost skills yet, also tell Claude: **"Install my skills."** The
`local-preview` and `localhost-up` skills ship with the project (in `.claude/skills/`), so Claude sets them up
from there — no manual download needed.

### Step 4. Set the design direction

Describe the design prompt for the project, or have Claude recreate the client's existing style guide. This
defines the colors, typography, components and overall direction before building begins.

### Step 5. Start the local preview (localhost)

Start localhost with the `local-preview` skill: the result is served at `http://localhost:<port>` and viewed
live in the browser with real images and animations. If the session drops or the server stops, bring it back
up with the `localhost-up` skill.

### Step 6. Verify or create the design system

Run the design-system skill to verify the client's existing design system, or build one from scratch. The
first page assembled is the Style Guide (colors, type scale, buttons, links, cards), which confirms the system
is applied.

### Step 7. Optimize the site

Before handoff, optimize the finished site — **compress all video and photos** so the page stays fast. Serve
appropriately sized assets (no oversized files), lazy-load media below the fold, and check load time and the
console (0 errors). See Part II, "Images & media" for the mandatory optimization rules Claude applies.

---

# Part II. Rules for Claude

Claude applies these rules on its own (they are placed in `CLAUDE.md`). The designer only provides the inputs —
fonts, colors, components — and does not perform these items by hand.

## 🌐 Site language → always English

The entire site is built in **English**, **even if the request is written in Ukrainian** (or any other
language). All content that ends up in the layout — headings, body copy, buttons, labels, navigation, alt
text, meta — is written in English. The designer may talk to Claude in any language; the **output on the page**
is always English. If the designer explicitly wants another language for the site content, that is a conscious
exception and must be stated directly.

## 🛑 Guardrail: Claude pushes back, it does not execute anything blindly

Claude is not a passive executor but a **taste editor**. If the designer's request violates a rule from this
part or is a clear anti-pattern, Claude **does not do it silently**. Instead it is obligated to:

1. **Stop** — do not start the implementation.
2. **Say plainly that it shouldn't be done this way** — briefly, in one or two sentences, why it harms the design.
3. **Ask again and wait for confirmation** — "are you sure you want it exactly like this?". Proceed only after
   the designer's conscious confirmation.

Example: the request "make a site with 4 different font families" → Claude does NOT build it right away. It
replies that more than 2–3 fonts break consistency and readability, and asks whether the designer really wants
this. The same applies to any violation: too many accent colors, unreadable contrast, excessive animation,
decoration without function, deviation from the grid/breakpoints, and so on.

The goal is to keep a weak decision from landing in the layout "on autopilot". The final word is always the
designer's, but **consciously**, not by default.

## 🫀 One system: Style Guide ⇄ site

The **Style Guide is the single source of truth** for the design system, and the site is built from the same
tokens — they are **one organism**, not two separate files. A change to a token in the Style Guide (a colour,
a type size, a radius, a button style) **propagates to the site**, and a token change made on the site is
reflected back in the Style Guide. Keep them in sync: share the same CSS custom properties (`--t-*`, colour
roles, radius, spacing) so editing one place updates both. Never let the Style Guide and the live design drift
apart.

## ⛔ Mandatory: no AI defaults, Awwwards level

The design system below is a **technical markup skeleton**, not a visual recipe. Visually, every project must
be **unique and creative, at the level of Awwwards work**.

**By default, typical AI elements are not used:**
- ❌ Eyebrow / kicker / small subtitle above a section heading — **forbidden by default**. Do NOT add a small
  label, tagline, or `• LABEL` line above an `<h2>` (or any section title). The default state is: **no eyebrow,
  no subtitle**. Add one ONLY when the designer asks for it by name in that specific request; never infer it,
  never add it "for balance", "for rhythm", or because a section "looks empty". If in doubt, leave it out.
- ❌ Numbers `01/02/03` when the content is not a real sequence.
- ❌ The templated hero "big number + label + gradient".
- ❌ Stock AI palettes (cream + serif + terracotta; black background + acid accent; "newspaper" hairline
  layout) — absent a corresponding brief requirement.
- ❌ Excessive animation, symmetric same-type blocks, decoration without function.

**Instead the following principles apply:** the hero states the key point (the most characteristic thing in the
product's field); typography forms the character of the page; structural elements encode content rather than
decorate it; one expressive **signature element**, the rest of the styling restrained; conscious creative risk;
a baseline level of quality (responsiveness, visible keyboard focus, `prefers-reduced-motion` support). Before
building, a short plan is drafted (palette, fonts, layout, signature) and checked against the brief: a default
solution that would fit any similar page is reworked.

## ⛔ Never carry UI between projects

This guide (and any demo like the `forma` homepage) defines **structure and method only — never a visual
template to copy.** Do NOT carry a previous project's concrete UI elements into a new design session: not the
header/navbar look, not the hero treatment, not button shapes, colours, gradients, card styles, or specific
component designs. Each project's UI is designed fresh from **its own** brief, brand and references. Reuse the
*rules* (breakpoints, naming, spacing/radius system, structure, guardrails) — not the *appearance*. If a new
project's header (or any component) starts resembling a previous one, that is a red flag: stop and redesign it
uniquely. Two projects should never look like siblings.

## Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Range | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| **Base** (default) | 992–1279 | base styles, cascade ↑↓ |
| Large / XL / XXL | 1280–1439 / 1440–1919 / 1920+ | ↑ up |
| Medium / Small / Tiny | 768–991 / 568–767 / 360–567 | ↓ down |

Styles set on Base cascade both up and down. **An override is applied only where the value differs from Base.**
All points are subject to checking: **1920 / 1440 / 1280 / 992 / 768 / 568 / 360**.

## Hero / banner — min-height (hardcoded, HOMEPAGE ONLY)

⚠️ **These values apply to the HOMEPAGE hero/banner only — strictly.** Inner pages (about, product, listing,
contact, etc.) have **smaller** banners; their height is left to the **designer's** discretion — do NOT apply
the homepage figures there. The values below are the mandatory homepage banner minimum height per breakpoint:

| Breakpoint | min-height (homepage) |
|---|---|
| Base (992–1279, incl. 1024) | `730px` |
| Large (1280–1439) | `730px` |
| XL (1440–1919) | `100vh` |
| XXL (1920+) | `100vh` |
| Medium (768–991) | `700px` |
| Small (568–767) | `630px` |
| Tiny (360–567) | `630px` |

These are **`min-height` only — never a fixed `height`.** The hero's `height` stays **`auto`**: it grows to fit
its content, and **content inside must never overlap** (no clipping, no stacked-on-top-of-each-other). The
min-height is just the floor. Base is `730px` and cascades up to Large; the override to `100vh` starts at
**1440** and carries to 1920. Downward: `700px` at ≤991, then `630px` at ≤767 (carries to 360).

```css
.hero { min-height: 730px; height: auto; }                    /* Base + Large (1024, 1280) — never a fixed height */
@media (min-width: 1440px) { .hero { min-height: 100vh; } }    /* XL + XXL (1440, 1920) */
@media (max-width: 991px)  { .hero { min-height: 700px; } }    /* Medium (768) */
@media (max-width: 767px)  { .hero { min-height: 630px; } }    /* Small + Tiny (568, 360) */
```

**Banner text — max 2 lines (strict).** In the hero, the H1 title and its paragraph are each **no more than
2 lines**. Write copy that fits in ≤2 lines at the given size, and cap it in CSS as a hard guard
(`display:-webkit-box; -webkit-box-orient:vertical; -webkit-line-clamp:2; overflow:hidden`). Never let hero
text run to 3+ lines.

**Header over the hero — HOOK (ALWAYS).** The header is **`position: fixed`** (out of the flow — like
`absolute`), so it **lays over** the banner. The header and banner are **NOT coupled** by any margin — never
pull the hero up with a negative margin to fake the overlap. Because the fixed header is out of flow, the banner
starts at the **very top of the page** and keeps its full natural `min-height` (e.g. `100vh` fills exactly one
viewport, header included); its height **never changes** when the header changes. **The hero's top padding is
ALWAYS `header-height + a minimum 60px gap`** so hero content clears the fixed header by **at least 60px** —
hardcode this on **every** breakpoint (never less than 60px of clearance anywhere). This works for a transparent
header (overlays the hero media) and a solid header alike.

**Header height is NEVER a fixed value — HOOK (ALWAYS).** Set the header `height: auto`. Its height is built
from **equal top and bottom padding around its tallest control** (the CTA button) — default **8px top / 8px
bottom**. **Always COMPUTE the resulting header min-height** = `padding-top + control-height + padding-bottom`,
**ROUND it to a whole pixel**, and use that single rounded number everywhere the header height is needed (the
hero's negative margin and the hero top padding above). Re-compute it whenever the control's size or the header
padding changes; never leave a stale hardcoded header height behind.

## Section structure (single for all pages)

```html
<section class="section section-name">
  <div class="base-container">
    <div class="section-head">
      <!-- No eyebrow/subtitle above the heading by default. Add one ONLY on explicit request. -->
      <h2 class="heading-spacer-top">Section Title</h2>
      <p class="lead">Supporting description.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- section content -->
  </div>
</section>
```

- A section = `<section>` + `section` + a subclass (`section trust`). Content is placed in `base-container`.
- **`base-container`:** `max-width` is defined by the designer per project (placed in a variable, single for
  all), `margin: auto`, `width: 100%`.
- **`base-container` left/right padding is hardcoded to `15px` on ALL breakpoints** (1920 / 1440 / 1280 / 992
  / 768 / 568 / 360). Set it as longhand `padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;` — do not vary it per
  breakpoint. This is the default and stays `15px` until the designer explicitly changes it. (Top/bottom
  padding of the container stays `0`; vertical rhythm comes from `section*` padding.)
- **Section padding is set only via `section` / `section-top` / `section-bot`** (scale below), not on the
  section's own class.
- Dark sections: the background is set on the section class; child elements get the `on-dark` class.

**Section Padding (the section's first class):**

| Class | Base | 1280+ | 768–991 | ≤767 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `section` | 100px 0 | 130px 0 | 80px 0 | 60px 0 |
| `section-top` | 100px 0 0 | 130px 0 0 | 80px 0 0 | 60px 0 0 |
| `section-bot` | 0 0 100px | 0 0 130px | 0 0 80px | 0 0 60px |

## Class naming

- **lowercase-hyphen**, section prefix: `trust-head`, `approach-title`, `foot-grid`.
- **Maximum 2 classes**: structural + modifier (`btn btn-primary`, `eyebrow on-dark`).
- Modifiers without a prefix (`on-dark`, `on-light`, `high`); states — `is-*`; CMS markers — `field-*` (removed
  after binding).
- **Every element has its own class; descendant selectors are not used** (✅ `.approach-title`
  ❌ `.trust-head h2`). Inline styles are not applied.

Key utilities: `on-dark`/`on-light`, `base-container`, `heading-spacer-top` (mt 22px), `small-spacer-top`
(mt 10px), `link-reset`, `relative` (z-index stack), `high` (accent in a heading).

## Colors

**Values differ in each project** (those below are an example). What stays constant is the **system**: correct
role names (Accent, Ink, Muted, Line Light…), unification (one color — one variable), **contrast checked per
WCAG** (≥4.5:1 for body text, ≥3:1 for large headings/UI) on real combinations.

Example roles: `Accent #0162ff` · `Accent Light #eaf1ff` · `Accent Dark #0148bf` · `White #fff` ·
`Off White #FAFAF9` · `Ink #111` · `Muted rgba(17,17,17,.62)` · `Line Light rgba(17,17,17,.10)` ·
`Line Dark rgba(255,255,255,.16)`.

## Images & media (auto-sourced + optimized)

Claude fills **every image slot with a real, top-quality photo automatically** — immediately, without being
asked and without leaving gradients/placeholders as the final state.

- **Top pick, deterministic.** Source real photography (stock API at runtime) and take the **best-matching,
  high-resolution result** for each slot — the top relevant hit, not a random one. The choice is **locked** so
  images don't reshuffle between reloads. The query matches the slot's context and the brand's editorial tone.
- **Right size per slot.** Request an appropriately sized asset — hero/full-width large, cards medium,
  thumbnails/avatars small. Never load an oversized image into a small slot.

**Resource optimization is mandatory on every image (never an afterthought):**
- `object-fit: cover` so images never stretch or distort; dimensions come from **CSS**, not `<img>` attributes.
- `loading="lazy"` for everything below the fold (hero/above-the-fold stays eager).
- Graceful `onerror` fallback so a broken URL fails silently (hide or drop to the block's gradient).
- Meaningful `alt` text (describe the content — never "image"/"photo").

**Video — HOOK (ALWAYS).** Every `<video>` is **`loop`ed** — it never stops on the last frame. Background/hero
video is **always** `muted loop playsinline autoplay` (all four, so it loops seamlessly and autoplays on mobile).
People/faces in a media slot must be **framed proportionally and consistently** — use `object-fit: cover` plus
`object-position` (e.g. `center 22%`) so faces are never cropped at the chin/forehead; keep the same crop across
a set (team grids, avatars). When a media block sits directly above the next section, mask the seam with a
bottom gradient that fades the media fully into the next section's background — never a hard crop.
- Reserve space to avoid layout shift (aspect-ratio / sized container).

## Typography

**Fonts are defined by the designer per project.** Mandatory rules:
- **Maximum 2 fonts** (ideal); **3 — the ceiling, only with justification**; **4 or more — forbidden**. On a
  request for 3+ fonts Claude stops, says it harms consistency and readability, and **asks the designer whether
  they are sure** (see "🛑 Guardrail" above) — and continues only after confirmation.
- **Priority — Google Fonts.** If a chosen font is **not on Google Fonts** (e.g. Helvetica Neue, Proxima Nova,
  a system font), Claude **triggers the guardrail**: it stops, says the font is not a Google Font, and **asks the
  designer to confirm it's OK** (license / web-embed / hosting) before using it — do not silently ship a
  non-Google font. Self-installation is never allowed. Continue only after the designer confirms.
- Roles: **Primary — headings H1–H6, logo, decor**; **Secondary — body text, UI, navigation, footer**.
- **Buttons/links** — at the designer's discretion; by default **Secondary** is recommended (better
  readability at small sizes and in interaction).

Scales (example): body text XXS 14 → XXL 24px; weights 300–800; line-height 1em→1.55; letter-spacing
−1.5→0px.

- **Whole-integer sizes only — no fractional px on ANY breakpoint.** Never ship sizes like `13.5px`, `15.5px`
  or a fluid `66.4px`. Round every size to the nearest whole pixel.
- **Prefer stepped sizes per breakpoint (media queries) over fluid `clamp()`.** `clamp(min, vw, max)` produces
  fractional values at in-between widths — avoid it for type. Instead set a whole-px size per breakpoint so each
  breakpoint renders a clean integer (e.g. Display `48 / 72 / 104px`, H2 `28 / 36 / 44px`). If `clamp()` is used
  at all, its `min` and `max` must be whole px and the result must still read as a clean integer.

## Text balance (line rag)

Multi-line text is written **balanced**, not left to wrap arbitrarily. The rule of thumb: **the first line is
about 10 characters longer than the line below it**, giving a deliberate top-heavy rag instead of a ragged or
bottom-heavy shape.

- Applies to: hero **H1 + its paragraph**, section **H2 + supporting description/lead**, and any headline+copy pair.
- Tune the **copy length** so each line breaks where intended; pair it with `text-wrap: balance` on headings
  and `text-wrap: pretty` on body copy.
- Avoid a short orphan first line, a single dangling word on the last line, and a long-then-tiny second line.
  Target shape: each line slightly shorter than the one above it (≈10 characters step).

Spacing is set with variables that have per-breakpoint modes; text margin is bound to the variable **Spacing
None (=0)**. Radius: XS 4 (tags) · S 6 (inputs) · M 8 (cards) · L 10 (panels) · XL 100px (pills — buttons/badges).

## Buttons, links and markup

**The set of buttons and links is defined by the designer per UI**; what stays constant is the system:
- Base `.btn` + one variant, maximum 2 classes.
- **Buttons are always built as `<a>`** (not `<button>`); icon and text as separate direct child elements; for
  toggles `e.preventDefault()` is used.
- **Links are not used without a class**: a class is assigned by purpose (`more`, `explore`, `link-reset`,
  `card-link`, `foot-link`).
- **All spacing is set via flex/grid containers** (`grid-row-gap`/`grid-column-gap` on the parent element),
  **not** on the texts, links or `<p>` themselves. A text element carries no spacing of its own.

## 🎬 Animation — cinematic, never default-simple

Motion is a core part of the quality bar, not decoration bolted on at the end.

- **Nothing default-simple.** No cheap, generic effects. Use **cinematic, smooth motion** (eased, purposeful,
  well-timed) — GSAP / ScrollTrigger (or equivalent), with proper easing curves and staggering.
- **Buttons are NOT a plain "hop".** Do NOT translate a button on the Y axis on hover (no `y:-3` lift, no
  bounce/jump) and no scale-pop. Use flat, considered micro-interactions instead: a smooth **background/colour
  fill**, an **underline/border** transition, or a **gentle glide of the arrow/icon** inside the button — no
  vertical movement of the button itself. If the only idea is "make it jump", leave it static.
- **Principles:** ease over linear; build hover timelines once and play/reverse them; stagger grouped items;
  respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (no motion when the user opts out); motion must have a reason (guide the eye,
  reveal hierarchy, give feedback) — never movement for its own sake. Excessive or symmetric same-type
  animation is still forbidden (see the AI-defaults rule).

## ⛔ Components — a single master element

If the designer defines an element as a **Component** (navbar, footer, card, button, CTA…), it is a **single
master element**, identical on all pages:
- The element is declared a master element; **all** its usage locations are registered.
- **A change in one place automatically propagates to all instances** on all pages. Manual duplication across
  pages is not used.
- Full identity (markup, classes, content, styles, states); only what is consciously exposed to a
  prop/variant may differ.
- **Before any edit to an element, check whether it is a component**; if so, changes are made to the master
  element and propagate to all instances, not pointwise on a single page.

---

# Part III. Webflow export

Applies **only when handing the project over to Webflow**. These rules ensure a correct and clean export of
markup, classes, variables and CMS.

## ⚠️ No Custom properties (the key condition for a correct export)

After handoff the **Custom properties panel must stay empty**. For this:
- **CSS is set only in longhand form** (border/padding/margin sides separately, four radii separately,
  `background-color`/`background-image` separately).
- **`grid-row-gap`/`grid-column-gap` is used; the `gap` property is not applied.**
- **Gradient/grid backgrounds** (`linear-gradient` + `background-size`) are moved to the **Site Head Code**,
  not set on a class.
- Custom properties on classes are not used.

## Animations — via attributes (handled by IX2/GSAP)

- `data-load="fade-in"` — elements above the fold (hero, navbar), appear on load.
- `data-scroll="fade-in"` — each section, appears on scroll.
- `data-scroll="fade-in-item"` — content blocks inside (cards, columns, heading wrap; grids — per-card/stagger).
  Not applied to: sections, containers, decor, "bare" headings, deep nodes.

## Handoff via the builder extension

Breakpoints (7) and Variables (colors, fonts, spacing, radius) are configured in Webflow before building
starts. Components correspond to **Symbols/Components** (navbar/footer stay as a Symbol).

CMS flow sequence: **Annotate** (`field-[slug]`) → **Build + Apply** → collection name + slug → **Scan Fields**
→ field types (Plain/Rich/Image) → **Create Schema** → **Load Items** → **Push Items** → **Bind Fields** →
**Remove Markers**.

**Not restorable via API** (done manually in Designer): binding a CMS List to a Source; mega-menu/dropdowns;
gradient backgrounds (moved to Site Head Code); real Input/Form. During handoff variables are bound: colors by
value, sizes ±1px with group separation (font-size → Typography, spacing → Spacing).
